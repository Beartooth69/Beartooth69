- 👋 Hi, I’m @Beartooth69
- 👀 I’m interested in Mesh Network communications development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Beartooth Android ATAK
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on integrating different mesh networks to create a more universal open source network for use to anyone similar to HAM radio.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a significant amount of training and skills form mil, LEO, medical, engineering but limited understanding of tech due to being an old fart.
